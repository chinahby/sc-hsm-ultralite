sc-hsm-embedded
===============

Light-weight CT-API and PKCS#11 library for using the SmartCard-HSM in embedded systems

Purpose
-------
This module has been developed for facilitate the integration of a SmartCard-HSM in
embedded systems with a little footprint. Rather than using a PC/SC daemon to manage
attached card readers and token, the smaller Card Terminal API (CT-API) is used.

Supported Hardware
------------------
The module can be compiled for Linux and Windows. It supports the SmartCard-HSM USB-stick
and SmartCard-HSM cards inserted into an Identive SCR 3310 reader.

The ctccid module uses standard functions from the CCID specification, so the driver may work
with other CCID compliant readers as well. However, the only reader used during tests is
the SCR 3310 and the USB-stick.

Build
-----

PCSC: 
 Windows: (Note that on Windows the "SmartCard Service" is the equivalent of the pcscd on Unix and is always installed.) 	
 Unix: The following packages are required
    pthread
	pcscd
	pcscd-dev

CTAPI: 
 Windows: (Using WinUSB is possible, but not recommended; should only be used for research.)
 Unix: The following packages are required
	libusb-1.0

Windows: Visual Studio 2013 is required.
Unix: Install the required packages and edit "Makefile.config" as necessary (PCSC is the default build). Run make.
